    <h1>SPIDER-MAN</h1>
    <p>Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He
        first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of
        Comic Books. He appears in American comic books published
        by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set
        in the Marvel Universe. In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his
        Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after
        his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
        with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, and accompanied him with many supporting
        characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson, Flash Thompson,
        Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such as Doctor
        Octopus, Green Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite
        from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to
        surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his "spidersense".</p>

    <p>In April 2015, Sony announced that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were writing and producing a
        Spider-Man animated comedy in development at Sony Pictures Animation. Spider-Man: Into the SpiderVerse is an
        upcoming American 3D computer-animated superhero
        film based on the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man, produced by Columbia
        Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in association with Marvel, and distributed by Sony Pictures
        Releasing. The 7th consecutive entry into the Spider-Man film
        series, the film is set in an alternate universe from Sony's other Spider-Man properties, but introduces
        a shared multiverse.</p>
